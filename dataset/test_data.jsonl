Using 'transfer' to send 'amount' to 'owner' introduces risks related to transaction order manipulation and potential re-entrancy attacks. To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to replace 'transfer' with 'call' and add a success verification. Here’s the corrected code:\n\n'function withdraw(uint amount) onlyOwner { (bool success,)=owner.call{value:amount}(\"\"); require(success,\"Transfer to owner failed\"); }'\n\nIn this updated code, 'call' is used with a success verification, reducing transaction ordering vulnerabilities and enhancing security against re-entrancy risks.", "category": "SWC-114"}
